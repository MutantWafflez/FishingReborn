Fishing Reborn completely reworks how fishing works in Terraria, namely through adding Stardew Valley's fishing minigame straight to Terraria!

Here's a checklist of changes that this mod makes:
+ Remake of Stardew Valley's Fishing Minigame added to Terraria
+ Complete rework of how fish are selected when fishing (Rare catches appear MUCH more often!)
+ All fish in Vanilla Terraria now have their own difficulty and movement type, with less common fish being harder to catch
+ Crates can be acquired along-side any fish catch, similar to Stardew Valley's "Treasure Chest" system while fishing (also crates are MUCH more common)

NOTICE: This mod is not balanced with usage of any mods that give fishing rods multiple bobbers/lures. The mod will still function normally with one of these mods installed, but using multiple lures will give multiple copies of the same catch, if the player successfully catches their fish.
